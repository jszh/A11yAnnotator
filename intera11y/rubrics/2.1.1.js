      tools: ['interact_and_observe', 'observe_state_after_activation'],
      rubric: `2.1.1 requires all functionality to be operable through a keyboard interface. It fails when a control that does something on click cannot receive keyboard focus (F54, F42), or receives focus but Enter/Space — or the keys its role implies, such as arrows in a slider, menu, listbox, grid or tab list — do nothing while a click does something (Trusted Tester 4.A). It passes when the same function is available from another keyboard-operable control on the page (say which), when the click handler does nothing a user notices or only forwards to a keyboard-operable element it contains, and for functionality that depends on the path of pointer movement (2.1.1's exception, e.g. freehand drawing). Drag-and-drop passes only with a keyboard way to do the same thing. Evidence: whether the element is in the recorded Tab sequence, its handlers, what Enter and Space did, what a click did, and arrow-key movement inside composite widgets. interact_and_observe tries keys on the focused element and compares with click.`,

      from: 'added',
      text: 'A control must not remove keyboard focus from itself when it receives it.',
      tools: ['interact_and_observe'],
      rubric: `A component that moves focus away as soon as it receives it cannot be operated from the keyboard (F55).`,

      from: 'added',
      text: 'Content and controls that appear on pointer hover must also be reachable with the keyboard.',
      tools: ['interact_and_observe'],
      rubric: `It fails when hovering is the only way to reveal controls or content that are not otherwise reachable from the keyboard (F54: functionality provided only through pointer-specific event handlers). It passes when focusing the trigger reveals the same content, or the content is reachable another way. Evidence: what hovering revealed, whether the trigger takes focus, whether focus reveals the same content.`,

      tools: ['interact_and_observe'],
      rubric: `A scrollable region fails when neither it nor any element inside it can receive keyboard focus, so its content cannot be scrolled with the keyboard (ACT 0ssw9k). An iframe with tabindex="-1" fails when it contains interactive elements, which then cannot be reached (ACT akn7bn).`,
    },
    {
      from: 'added',
      text: 'Keyboard operation must not require specific timings for individual keystrokes.',
      tools: ['interact_and_observe'],
      rubric: `2.1.1 requires operation "without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes". It fails when an operation happens only while a key is held for a duration, with no alternative. Evidence: whether the control responded only to a held key.`,
