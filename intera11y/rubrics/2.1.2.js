      rubric: `It fails when, from inside a component (a region, widget, embedded object, iframe, dialog or single element), Tab and Shift+Tab both keep focus inside and no standard exit — Escape for a dialog, menu or pop-up; arrow keys within a composite widget followed by Tab; a keyboard-operable close control inside it — releases it (F10; Trusted Tester 4.B). It also fails when an element returns focus to itself whenever focus leaves it, and when the Tab sequence loops back into itself so that content after the loop can never be reached. It passes for a modal dialog that holds focus while open but closes with Escape or a keyboard-operable close or cancel control, and for a trap in one direction when the other standard direction lets focus leave and reach the rest of the page. Evidence: the recorded Tab sequence and how it ended (across the document boundary is normal; revisiting a stop without reaching the boundary means focus looped), tabbable elements never reached, and the region, focus-retention and fixed-set detector results (directions trapped, whether Escape or a close control released focus). interact_and_observe (focus an element inside, then press Tab, Shift+Tab, Escape; read activeAfter) tests it live.`,
